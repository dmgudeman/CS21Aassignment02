# CS21Aassignment02
This program takes in a string from the user. It translates it into a "secret
code. The code is: if a word starts with a vowel, "way" is appended to the end
of the word. Otherwise the first letter is cut from the front of the word and
appended to the end of the word and then "ar" is appended. The modified string
is printed to the display.
